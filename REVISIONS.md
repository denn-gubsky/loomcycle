# LoomCycle release history

Per-version release notes from v0.4.0 onward. The current and immediately previous releases are also summarised in the main [`README.md`](README.md); older releases live here.

For the **public roadmap** (planned v0.8.16 through v1.0 work — Question tool, Pause / Resume / Snapshot, distribution, operator postures), see [`docs/PLAN.md`](docs/PLAN.md).

## What's in v1.44.1

**🩹 Patch — the erasure report omitted planes it had examined.** Reporting accuracy only; nothing about what gets deleted changes.

Found by driving v1.44.0 against a live deployment rather than a fixture. A dry run for a real subject returned `{"chats":2,"interrupts":0,"memory_rows":2}` — but `credentials`, `token_limits`, `path_entries` and `sql_memory_scopes` are all examined on that path, and all four were missing. An operator reading that cannot tell *"this subject had no credentials"* from *"credentials were never looked at"*, which in a compliance report is the entire question being asked. It is the same ambiguity between FAILED and EMPTY that the `errors` field exists to prevent, reintroduced one field lower down.

Two causes. The executor accumulated with `deleted[k]++` from an absent key, so a plane that removed nothing left no trace; every considered plane is now registered at zero up front, which establishes the invariant that **a key's presence means the plane was examined and its value means how many rows went**. And the report set `sql_memory_scopes` only when it found one, so absence meant either no scope or no look.

SQL Memory is the one genuinely conditional plane: with the subsystem unconfigured it really is unexamined, so rather than omit it the report now SAYS so in `notes`. Exactly one of the two must hold — counted, or declared unexamined — and the regression test asserts that as an exclusive-or rather than checking either alone.

⚠️ **No schema change, no wire change, no adapter change.** Existing `/v1/_erasure` responses gain keys; none are removed or renamed.

## What's in v1.44.0

**🧹 A subject erasure you can run, and — more to the point — one that tells you what it did not reach.** Two new endpoints, one new store method, one additive index. The memory bundle stays opt-in.

**`GET /v1/_erasure?tenant=&subject=` reports one person's footprint in three tiers**, and the tiers are separated by what they *guarantee* rather than by what they contain:

| tier | what | deletable |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | chats, user-scope memory, the user's SQL Memory scope, path entries | ✅ existing primitives |
| 2 | credentials, token limits, interrupts, usage ledger | ❌ nothing, before this release |
| 3 | facts about the subject in a shared agent's or another user's scope | ❌ not addressable at all |

Tier 2 is listed apart because the distinction is not row count but whether anything can remove them. A subject's **encrypted credentials** surviving an "erasure" is the worst entry on that list, and it is invisible unless something counts it.

**`POST /v1/_erasure` executes tiers 1 and 2, and defaults to doing nothing.** `dry_run` is a nullable boolean on purpose: an omitted field — or `POST {}` from a client with a buggy serialiser — must mean *do nothing*, and a plain boolean would make the zero value destructive. A live run additionally requires `confirm` to equal `subject`; a subject id that matches nothing is harmless, one that matches the **wrong person** is not. An admin token must name the tenant explicitly, because a subject id is only unique within one and an unnamed tenant would not merely report the wrong people — it would delete them.

⚠️ **The residue report is one-shot, and this is the property to understand before using it.** Tier 3 is reachable only by tracing provenance from the subject's chats, and the erasure deletes those chats. Afterwards the trace handle is gone: a report run later shows `residue: 0` **while the facts are still stored**. That is not a defect to be fixed at this layer — it is what "the subject's chats are deleted" means when chats are the only index into derived facts. So the residue is measured before anything is removed, the response states that **it is the only durable record of what was not reached**, and the report closes the matching lie from its own side by rendering tier 3 **UNDETERMINABLE** rather than `0` when there are no sessions to trace from. That is exactly the state a subject is left in after an erasure, and exactly when someone would read a zero as confirmation the job is done. **Retain the erasure response.**

**The usage/cost ledger is retained by design, and says so.** Cost rows are accounting records an operator may be legally required to keep; the correct treatment is to break the personal linkage rather than destroy the totals. That is a row merge rather than a delete — `usage_archive` carries `user_id` inside its primary key, so anonymising means folding rows into the empty-string bucket and summing — and it is left for its own change rather than swept in. It appears under `retained` with the reason, because an erasure that lists only its successes reads as complete.

**Deleting an interrupt is not filtered by status.** An interrupt row holds the model's question *and* the user's free-text answer, so removing only the pending ones would report success having left the conversation behind. The new `InterruptDeleteAllByUser` is also uncapped, unlike the lister it mirrors: a partial delete that reports success is the one outcome an erasure must never produce.

**🧹 Dead chunk references are now collected.** A chunk is referenced from five places, and neither `delete_chunk` nor the read-time guard reaches all of them — the body delete runs after the transaction commits (a different store, so it cannot join the txn), an out-of-band delete bypasses the tool entirely, and the read-time guard makes an orphan *invisible*, which is precisely why nothing ever notices it. This is always-on integrity rather than opt-in policy: everything it removes is unreachable by definition. Two guards refuse rather than proceed — a fault reading the live chunk set aborts the scope, and a scope holding bodies but zero chunk rows is treated as mis-resolved rather than fully deleted, because being wrong there costs every body in the scope.

**🔬 The memory eval never sent the ontology it was scoring.** `{{memory:ontology}}` reached the model as nineteen literal characters, which explains the v1.43.0 finding about entity types outside the ontology: the model was never shown one. The A/B rerun settles it — **a confirmed ontology eliminates statement-class-as-entity-type entirely (5 → 0)**, retiring the type-validation follow-up that release proposed.

⚠️ **One additive migration (0065)** — a partial index on `memory(tenant_id, source_session_id)`. No wire change, no adapter change. The erasure surface is **HTTP-only in this release**: there is no MCP tool, no gRPC RPC, no adapter method and no Web UI page, unlike every other substrate surface. An operator drives it with `curl`.

## What's in v1.43.2

**🔎 The entity graph was correct and unfindable.** The first live consolidation pass built a graph, and inspecting it showed why the retrieval half was unusable. Runtime + bundle; no migration, no wire change.

**`graph_recall` searched every chunk in the scope, and the scope is where the document store lives.** Measured on the reference deployment: **2 entity chunks among 3,071 chunks across 150 documents**. So "what do we know about X" answered with documentation prose. Discovery now requires a `chunk_memory_meta` row — a chunk without one is prose, not part of the graph — and it is restricted for DISCOVERY only, never for explicit `seed_ids`, which exist precisely to hand in results found some other way. That is the same division the temporal filter already draws.

This is the failure mode a fixture corpus cannot show. Every test corpus is a clean room; signal-to-noise is a property of the corpus rather than the code, and 2-of-3071 is only visible where the other 3,069 exist.

**The title match was a bare substring, so `statin` matched `re-statin-g`.** Verbatim from the deployment: a query for "statin" returned a configuration paragraph reading "an overlay that puts OAuth on top WITHOUT restating the base matrix". Whole-word matching now happens in Go, because neither storage tier has a portable word boundary and the padded-LIKE trick misfires on punctuation — a title ending in a colon, or a hyphenated term, would stop matching. The LIKE remains a coarse prefilter and the fetch over-fetches, so filtering can never silently return fewer seeds than were asked for, which would read as "the graph holds nothing else" rather than "the prefilter was noisy". A query with no word character at its edges falls back to substring instead of matching nothing.

**A statement class is not an entity type.** The pass typed "the user prefers statin alternatives" as `preference:user` — the entity of type *preference* named *user*. That is not a harmless mislabel: **every preference about the user collapses onto that one node**, producing a hub that means nothing and burying the facts it should organise. An invented type such as `process` makes one strangely-labelled node; a statement class makes a magnet. `preference` and `fact` are now refused as entity types (they belong to the extractor's `class` vocabulary, and are in the ontology because the memory tier needs them as chunk types), and the refusals are COUNTED — a pass that mirrored nothing because every type was rejected must not look like a pass with nothing to mirror.

⚠️ **A claim in the v1.43.0 notes was wrong, and is corrected there.** Those notes said the extractor's inconsistent subject spelling forked one person into two graph nodes. It does not: `slug()` lowercases and its stopword list already drops `a`/`an`/`the`, so `the user`, `user` and `The user` all reduce to one key. The claim had been read out of the code rather than run — and it surfaced because the fix written for it changed nothing when removed, which is only possible if it was doing nothing. The regression test is kept regardless, because the guarantee is load-bearing and currently emerges from a stopword list nobody would think to protect: deleting the articles from it forks every subject whose name carries one.

**Still accepted, and stated rather than hidden:** entity types OUTSIDE the ontology (`profession`, `setting`, `process`, `task` all appeared in the eval). Refusing them needs the effective ontology reachable from the consolidator, which by design cannot read a tenant-scope document — a follow-up, and far lower stakes than the magnet above.

**🧰 Deploy fixes for the serve-and-test posture.** The sandbox sidecar pin is bumped so `expose` actually works: #891 set `SANDBOX_EXPOSE_NETWORK` but left the sidecar on an image predating the expose seam it added in the same change, so the old sidecar silently dropped the unknown field, opened a plain session and returned no exposed host — a serve-and-test run "succeeded" while the browser could not resolve the alias. The rest of the family had drifted too. And the TrueNAS deploy gains a **browser + sandbox variant**: build a feature in an isolated sandbox, serve it, and test it in a headless browser in one run, which was previously reachable only in the cloud deployment.

⚠️ **No migration, no schema change, no wire change.** Adapters unchanged. The memory bundle remains opt-in with its schedule at `enabled: false`. If you have already run a pass, entity nodes typed `preference:` or `fact:` from before this release are still in the store — they are inert rather than harmful (nothing reads them as entities now) but worth deleting if you want a clean graph.

## What's in v1.43.1

**🩹 A tenant-scope document listed in the Path tree and then opened with no chunks.** UI + adapter types; no runtime change, no migration.

Reported against v1.43.0: the ontology document showed nothing in the browser while Settings → Ontology said **Confirmed**. The document was fine — root plus three term chunks, the full template, status confirmed. The VIEWER was reading the wrong store.

`PathExplorer` browses `agent|user|tenant` and handed the scope to the document viewer as `scope={scope === "agent" ? "agent" : "user"}`, because `DocScope` was `"agent" | "user"`. So `"tenant"` had nowhere to go and became `"user"`: the document listed in the tree (which does support tenant) and its chunk query then asked the user scope, which correctly answered with nothing.

**Nothing failed anywhere.** A document with no chunks and a document you are looking for in the wrong scope render identically — no error, no distinguishable empty state — so it surfaced only because a human noticed two screens disagreeing.

`DocScope` was written when Documents genuinely refused tenant scope and its comment said exactly that; the runtime gained it in v1.41.0 and the type never followed. **The same fact turned out to be declared in four places** — `@loomcycle/client`'s `DocumentToolInput`, `@loomcycle/explorer`'s `DocScope`, the Web UI's own `DocScope`, and the runtime's schema — and three of the four were stale. All three are widened, each carrying the reason so the next reader does not re-narrow it. Deep links to a tenant document (`?scope=tenant`) now open too, rather than folding to the user scope.

Worth recording how the fix nearly shipped under-covered. Widening `DocScope` does **not** prevent the fold returning: `"agent" | "user"` is still assignable to the wider type, so the compiler stays silent, and a data-layer test passes because the fold happens a layer above it. Restoring the exact bad line left every check green. **Type systems catch widening errors, not narrowing ones** — discarding a case is legal everywhere — so the guard is a source assertion on the component, blunt and pinned to a literal on purpose.

**📦 `@loomcycle/client` publishes at 1.43.1** (from 1.38.0), because the fix includes its `DocumentToolInput.scope` type and the Web UI's temporary `as unknown as` casts come out on the next published version. A tenant document additionally needs the operator to grant BOTH `memory_scopes` and `sql_scopes` with `tenant`, since a document spans both planes; the type comment says so now.

Also corrects the adapter version stated in the v1.42.x and v1.43.0 notes: it was **1.38.0** at both tags, not 1.30.0 — a stale figure carried from memory into eight places. The runtime behaviour those notes describe is unaffected.

⚠️ **The Web UI is embedded in the binary, so rebuild the image rather than restarting it** — a restart serves the old SPA and the symptom persists.

## Earlier releases

Notes for **v1.43.0 back to v0.4.0** (181 releases) are not repeated here.

They were dropped from this file deliberately rather than lost: every tag carries
its own annotated message, and every release has a GitHub page with the same
notes. This file had grown to 185 sections and ~700 KB, which made it useless for
its actual job — telling you what changed *recently*.

- **Per-release notes:** <https://github.com/denn-gubsky/loomcycle/releases>
- **From a checkout:** `git tag --sort=-v:refname` to list, `git show <tag>` for one
- **What a version contains:** `git log --oneline <older>..<newer>`
