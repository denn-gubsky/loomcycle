	"op=merge_subjects folds one SUBJECT (duplicate) into another (survivor) when both name the same entity — say person:ada-king and person:ada-lovelace. " +
	"Name each by its document id or its natural key; both must be subjects of the tenant scope. " +
	"In one transaction the duplicate's facts move under the survivor (their keys unchanged), every statement about the duplicate is copied onto the survivor and the original expired as merged (kept for as-of reads, never deleted), " +
	"and the duplicate stays as a retired document that keeps its key and path and records where it went (fields.merged_into, status merged). " +
	"A user the duplicate is bound to is bound to the survivor instead; if the survivor is bound to a different user the merge is refused (principal_conflict). " +
	"A `merged` event then goes to the tenant's memory/subjects channel for the links agent, unless your access-control rules hide part of the tenant's documents from you; not_announced then says why. " +
	"Returns {tenant, duplicate, survivor, facts_moved, statements_repointed, statements_retired, statements_left, not_announced}. " +
	"It cannot be undone by another call: choose the survivor with care. " +
	"op=bind_principal records which user of the tenant a subject IS (person:ada-lovelace is the account u-ada): name the subject by document id or natural key, and the user by subject id; principal \"\" clears the binding. " +
	"Erasing that user then finds the subject, reports it, clears the binding and announces `erased` — the subject itself is never deleted. " +
	"One user per subject (clear a binding before binding another user) and one subject per user. The user must be registered in the tenant (any status). " +
	"Returns {tenant, document_id, root_chunk_id, natural_key, path, principal, previous, changed}. " +
	"For an admin or a tenant operator only, holding write on the subject's document (both documents, for a merge). The tenant is your own unless you are an admin and pass another. " +
	"A refusal is {code, error}. merge_subjects: same_subject, not_a_subject, subject_not_in_scope, already_merged, principal_conflict, forbidden, merge_conflict. " +
	"bind_principal: subject_not_found, not_a_subject, binding_conflict (names the subject that holds the binding), principal_not_found, forbidden, invalid_request, unavailable. " +
	"Do NOT use it to rename a subject or change its type — edit the subject's document with the document tool."
